# appium-java-client-android-showcase-poc

This is a POC automation test written using Appium and Java Client

## Prerequisites

- Appium installed 

```npm install -g appium```

and Appium server running

```appium```

- Java and Android studio installed and paths configured -> verify by executing the following:

```
echo $JAVA_HOME
echo $ANDROID_HOME
```

- Android Emulator running (tested on emulator running Android 8.1 -> emulator config is present in src/test/java/data/Config.java class and might need to be changed, if your emulator has different settings)

- Maven installed -> verify by:

```mvn --version```

Note:

As this is a POC, not all of the concepts are polished. The following needs attention:
- the first start of a webview during authentication test will end up in showing the 'accept and continue' screen, which will break the tests.
- without PIN set on an emulator, warning will also be shown and may break the tests
- in src/test/java/data/AuthPage.java you need to provide values for USERNAME and PASSWORD constants
- it may occur that the tests will fail some time, even though they usually pass - this still needs to be investigated
- make sure that if you are running the tests, the old version of Android Showcase Application is removed from your emulator. This can also be achieved by uncommenting the following line in src/test/java/data/Config.java:

```//dCaps.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.FULL_RESET, true); // re-install the app before executing ```

## To run the tests from Eclipse:

right click on test package and select *Run As JUnit test*

## To run from the terminal, enter into the root of the project and and execute the following command:

```mvn test```
